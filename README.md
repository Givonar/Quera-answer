# Finding the Answer to a Question
Each question on the Quera site has an ID that you can see in the question link. The answers are also named with the ID in the [answer](https://github.com/givonar/quera-answer/tree/main/answer) folder.

So, the first step is to find the question ID and then the answer.

## Finding the Question ID
This link is one of the questions available on the Quera site:
`https://quera.org/problemset/2636` and you can see the question ID in the last part of the link after `https://quera.org/problemset/`, which is `2636` for this question.

## Finding the Answer to the Question
Now that we have the question ID, it's time to find the answer. One way is to sit like a squirrel and look at the names of all the files in the answer folder, hoping to find the answer to our desired question, or come and enter the official method and find it through the link. The choice of method is up to you, but I'm not crazy enough to manually search for the file, so I can remember the link method.

To start:
- `https://github.com/Givonar/quera-answer/blob/main/answer/10162.cpp`
- `https://github.com/Givonar/quera-answer/blob/main/answer/280.cpp`
- `https://github.com/Givonar/quera-answer/blob/main/answer/3406.cpp`

These are links to some of the answers, and as you can see, the part `https://github.com/Givonar/quera-answer/blob/main/answer/` is the same in all of them because this part refers to the path of the answer folder on the GitHub servers and is the fixed part of the answer links. But we are concerned with the next part, i.e., `10162.cpp`, `280.cpp`, and `3406.cpp`. These are the names of our answer files, which, as mentioned earlier, are named with the question ID (that .cpp is the format of the c++ files, if you don't know this either, I don't know what you're doing here).

So, the only thing you need to do is to replace the question ID with XXX in the link below and open it in your browser.
```

```
